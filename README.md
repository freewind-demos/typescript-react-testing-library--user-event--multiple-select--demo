TypeScript React "react-testing-library" "user-event" Multiple Select Demo
===========================================================================

Try "user-event" in tests to simulate user selected options in a multiple select.

But not all work as expected:
1. check `option.selected` is work as expected
2. `onChange` callback doesn't have expected values

```
npm install
npm run test
```

It will fail and have error messages in console.
